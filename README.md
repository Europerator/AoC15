# Advent of Code 2015

## Introduction
I'm using the Advent of Code calendars as an exercise corpus for my own practice. Due to limitations in my current work environment, I'm practicing my programming skills in C# on Visual Studio, neither of which are my programming language or IDE of choice. Still, I believe this will prove an interesting learning experience, both in terms of problem-solving and habit-building through the use of Git and a work environment that I would qualify of sub-optimal.

## Current progress
Day 1: finished.

Day 2: work in progress.
